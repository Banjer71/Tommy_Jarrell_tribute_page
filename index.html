              <h2>His life</h2>
                <p>By the age of 16, he was playing for dances in Round Peak. According to Cece Conway’s citation for Jarrell’s 1981 Brown-Hudson award from the North Carolina Folklore Society, Tommy and his Uncle Charlie played in one room, his daddy and another fellow played in another room, and people danced in both rooms. Conway also reports Jarrell’s account of his marriage proposal to Nina Lowe in 1923, in which he advised her that, “‘You know I make whiskey, I drink whiskey, and I play cards and I gamble a little once in a while. I play the fiddle and I go to dances, and I ain’t never figuring on quitting doing that. But now if you think we can get along all right, we’ll get married.’ She said, ‘I believe we can get along all right.’ So we did.” And the music continued.</p>
                <p>On his retirement after 41 years working for the North Carolina Highway Department, Tommy Jarrell returned to playing the music he had learned in his youth. He came to the attention of young revivalist old-time musicians, many of whom he hosted at his house. “Going to see Tommy” became something of a pilgrimage and rite of passage for this younger generation of musicians, and Jarrell’s hospitality remains legendary.</p>
